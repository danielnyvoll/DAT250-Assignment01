### Trouble With Code
Setting up Postman and a REST API presented a few challenges, particularly given the age of my Mac, which is a model from 2013. The older hardware sometimes struggled with the resource demands of the software, leading to slower response times and occasional crashes. Updating my operating system and optimizing system settings helped to mitigate some issues, but it was clear that the aging hardware posed limitations. 

Additionally, configuring Postman to interact seamlessly with the REST API required some extra effort, as compatibility concerns surfaced. Despite these challenges, perseverance and troubleshooting ultimately allowed for a functional setup, demonstrating the importance of adapting tools to accommodate older systems and addressing compatibility issues in software integration.
